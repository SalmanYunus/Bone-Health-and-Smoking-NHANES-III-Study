# Bone-Health-and-Smoking-NHANES-III-Study

### Introduction :
The boneExam dataset is a valuable resource for researchers studying bone health and related factors in adults. The data was collected as part of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a large-scale study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1988 to 1994. NHANES III was designed to assess the health and nutrition status of the non-institutionalized U.S. population. The boneExam dataset specifically focuses on bone health measures and smoking history among survey participants.

### Background:
Bone health is a crucial aspect of overall well-being, particularly as individuals age. Bones are dynamic tissues that undergo continuous remodeling, involving the breakdown of old bone tissue and the formation of new bone tissue. This process maintains bone strength and structure. However, with aging, the balance between bone formation and breakdown shifts, leading to a gradual decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), a key determinant of bone strength.

### NHANES III and the boneExam Dataset:

The NHANES III boneExam dataset provides a comprehensive collection of data on bone health and smoking history among a representative sample of the U.S. adult population. The dataset includes information on:

1. Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity).  
2. Anthropometric measurements (weight, body mass index, â€¦ ,Thigh Circumference).  
3. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements of the femur neck, trochanter, and total hip.
4. Smoking history (ever smoked, current smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked per day, age at smoking initiation).
